## Problem Statement
FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPER ASSESSMENT

### Instructions:

You need to develop a single page web app (preferably, but not necessarily in AngularJS).
The app should list and search for banks that are fetched from the API mentioned below. There
should be a dropdown for cities (just put in 5 cities in there) and there is a search bar. As I type
in the search area, the table should be dynamically filtered (client-side filtering). Search should
be across all fields.


### Essentials your applications should have:

- [x] 1. bank search screen which would show a list of banks
- [x] 2. user should be able to search by text for the banks, across all the fields (important: there
would be no search button)
- [x] 3. pagination for the results of the search, the user should be able to select page size
- [x] 4. mark some banks as favourites. View banks that were marked as favourites (favourites
should persist state event if the website is refreshed or reloaded)
- [x] 5. API calls should be cached
- [x] 6. your application should be deployed to Heroku / Github pages


### For extra fun, you can try the following:

- [x] 1. clicking on bank name would redirect to a bank page, with a route like banks/{bankid}
that displays the details of the bank
Please note: below mock-ups are for reference only. You are free to do the styling as you
please.

### Deliverables:

- [x] 1. Hosting URL on Heroku / Github pages
- [x] 2. Github repo link to your solution
- [x] 3. Time taken to complete this
